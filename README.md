## PetSkin 2021
The PetSkin 2021 was collected from October 2021 to February 2022 by the [Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing Laboratory (AIIP Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/aiip/) in Sun Moon University, South Korea. The skin images of dogs and cats were collected by Hangang Veterinary Hospital in Seoul (Dr. Kyeong Guen Yu) using a digital microscope, and were uploaded through a mobile app **PETSnD** (available on both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petsn) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/petsnd/id1587486326)) The dataset finally consists of total 413 images which were taken from 49 dogs and 7 cats.

Diagnostic information was provided along with skin images respectively. The skin images were classfied with five diagnosis classes such as normal, bacterial, fungal, atopic, and others. The following image shows an example of skin images.
